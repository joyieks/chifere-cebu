  console.log('üîç [Signup] OTP result:', otpResult);
  setStep(4);
  showToast('Registration successful! Please check your email and confirm it.', 'success');
}

// After

  console.log('‚úÖ [Signup] Buyer registration successful, going to success step');
  setLoading(false);
  setStep(4);

}
```
