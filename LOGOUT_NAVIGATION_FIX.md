# Logout Navigation Fix

## Issue
When clicking logout, the user was not being redirected to the landing page. The logout function was working (clearing session data), but the navigation wasn't happening properly.

## Root Cause
The logout handlers in various components were calling the `logout()` function but not waiting for it to complete before navigating. Since `logout()` is an async function, the navigation was happening before the logout process finished, causing the user to remain on the current page.

## Solution
Updated all logout handlers to properly await the logout function and handle navigation after logout completion.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Navigation.jsx**
- Made `handleLogout` async
- Added `await logout()` to wait for completion
- Added proper error handling
- Navigation happens after successful logout

### 2. **Buyer_layout.jsx**
- Made `handleLogout` async
- Added `await logout()` to wait for completion
- Added proper error handling
- Navigation happens after successful logout

### 3. **AdminNavbar.jsx**
- Added necessary imports (`useNavigate`, `useToast`)
- Created `handleLogout` function with async/await
- Added proper error handling
- Navigation happens after successful logout

## Code Changes

### Before:
```jsx
const handleLogout = () => {
  logout();
  showToast('Logged out successfully', 'success');
  navigate('/');
};
```

### After:
```jsx
const handleLogout = async () => {
  try {
    await logout();
    showToast('Logged out successfully', 'success');
    navigate('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    showToast('Logout failed. Please try again.', 'error');
  }
};
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Proper Async Handling**: Waits for logout to complete before navigating
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Shows error messages if logout fails
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: All logout buttons work the same way
- ✅ **Reliable Navigation**: User is properly redirected to landing page
- ✅ **Better UX**: Success/error messages are shown appropriately

## Testing
1. Login with any account (admin, seller, or buyer)
2. Click the logout button
3. Should see "Logged out successfully" toast
4. Should be redirected to landing page (`/`)
5. Should not be able to access protected routes

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Navigation.jsx` - Fixed main navigation logout
- `src/components/pages/Buyer/Buyer_Menu/Buyer_Layout/Buyer_layout.jsx` - Fixed buyer layout logout
- `src/components/pages/Admin/AdminNavbar.jsx` - Fixed admin navbar logout

## Notes
The logout process now properly waits for the session to be cleared before navigating, ensuring the user is properly logged out and redirected to the landing page.
