# React Hooks Rule Violation Fixed - OTP Modal Now Works!

## ✅ **CRITICAL ERROR FIXED**

### **🚨 The Problem:**
```
Uncaught Error: Rendered fewer hooks than expected. This may be caused by an accidental early return statement.
```

This was a **React Hooks Rule Violation** - I had placed the OTP modal early return BEFORE all the `useEffect` hooks, which violates React's fundamental rule that hooks must always be called in the same order.

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **Moved OTP Modal Check After All Hooks**
   ```jsx
   // BEFORE (WRONG - caused hooks rule violation):
   useEffect(() => { ... }, []);
   
   // FORCE OTP MODAL TO SHOW (early return before other hooks)
   if (showOtpModal || ...) {
     return <OTPModal />;
   }
   
   useEffect(() => { ... }, []); // This hook was never reached!
   
   // AFTER (CORRECT - all hooks called first):
   useEffect(() => { ... }, []);
   useEffect(() => { ... }, []);
   
   // FORCE OTP MODAL TO SHOW (after all hooks)
   if (showOtpModal || ...) {
     return <OTPModal />;
   }
   ```

2. **React Hooks Rules:**
   - ✅ **All hooks must be called in the same order every time**
   - ✅ **No early returns before all hooks are called**
   - ✅ **Hooks must be at the top level of the component**

### **🎯 Why This Fixes Everything:**

1. **Hooks Rule Compliance** - All `useEffect` hooks are now called before any early returns
2. **Consistent Rendering** - React can properly track hook order
3. **No More Crashes** - The "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error is gone
4. **OTP Modal Works** - Modal will now render properly when triggered
