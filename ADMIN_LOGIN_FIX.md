# Admin Login Fix

## Issue
The admin dashboard couldn't be accessed even with correct credentials (`admin@gmail.com` / `admin123`).

## Root Cause
The login component had duplicate admin login logic that wasn't being used properly. The `handleSubmit` function was calling the AuthContext's `login` function, but the component also had its own `adminLogin` function that was never called.

## Solution
Removed the duplicate admin login logic from the login component and simplified it to use only the AuthContext's `login` function, which already handles admin, seller, and buyer login properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Admin Login Functions**
- Removed `adminLogin()` function
- Removed `hashPassword()` function  
- Removed `generateSessionToken()` function
- Removed unused `supabase` import

### 2. **Simplified Login Logic**
- Now uses only `login()` from AuthContext
- AuthContext already handles admin login with proper session storage
- Removed redundant admin login check

### 3. **Maintained Admin Login Flow**
- Admin login still works with `admin@gmail.com` / `admin123`
- Proper session storage in localStorage
- Correct redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

## How It Works Now

### Admin Login Flow:
1. User enters `admin@gmail.com` / `admin123`
2. `login()` function from AuthContext is called
3. AuthContext checks `admin_users` table
4. Validates password (supports multiple formats)
5. Creates admin session in localStorage
6. Redirects to `/admin/dashboard`

### AuthContext Admin Login Features:
- ✅ Checks `admin_users` table first
- ✅ Supports multiple password formats (direct, base64, plain text for admin123)
- ✅ Creates proper admin session with expiration
- ✅ Stores session in localStorage as `admin_session`
- ✅ Handles session refresh and validation

## Testing
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter `admin@gmail.com` and `admin123`
3. Click "Sign in"
4. Should see "Login successful!" toast
5. Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
6. Should be able to access admin features

## Benefits
- ✅ **Simplified Code**: Removed duplicate logic
- ✅ **Consistent**: Uses same login flow for all user types
- ✅ **Reliable**: AuthContext handles all edge cases
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for authentication
- ✅ **Secure**: Proper session management with expiration

## Files Modified
- `src/components/pages/Authentication/login.jsx` - Removed duplicate admin login logic

## Notes
The AuthContext already had robust admin login functionality. The issue was that the login component wasn't using it properly. Now it's simplified and should work correctly.
