# Logout Error Fix

## Issue
The logout process was failing with a "403 Forbidden" error and "AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!" when trying to sign out from Supabase. This happened when there was no active Supabase session to sign out from.

## Root Cause
The logout function was always trying to call `supabase.auth.signOut()` even when there was no active session, causing the error. This could happen when:
- The session had already expired
- The user was already logged out
- There was no Supabase session to begin with (e.g., admin users)

## Solution
Made the logout function more robust by checking for an active Supabase session before attempting to sign out, and handling signOut errors gracefully.

## Changes Made

### **Enhanced Logout Function**
- ✅ **Session Check**: Check if there's an active Supabase session before calling `signOut()`
- ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**: Don't throw errors for signOut failures
- ✅ **Always Clear State**: Clear user state regardless of Supabase signOut result
- ✅ **Better Logging**: More informative console messages
- ✅ **Return Success**: Return success even if signOut fails, since user state is cleared

## Code Changes

### Before:
```jsx
// Sign out from Supabase
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
if (error) {
  console.error('❌ [AuthContext] Supabase signOut error:', error);
  throw error;
}
console.log('✅ [AuthContext] Supabase signOut successful');
```

### After:
```jsx
// Check if there's an active Supabase session before trying to sign out
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

if (session) {
  // Sign out from Supabase only if there's an active session
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
  if (error) {
    console.warn('⚠️ [AuthContext] Supabase signOut error (non-critical):', error);
    // Don't throw error for signOut failures - continue with logout
  } else {
    console.log('✅ [AuthContext] Supabase signOut successful');
  }
} else {
  console.log('ℹ️ [AuthContext] No active Supabase session found, skipping signOut');
}
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No More Errors**: Eliminates "AuthSessionMissingError" and 403 Forbidden errors
- ✅ **Robust Logout**: Works regardless of session state
- ✅ **Better UX**: Logout always succeeds and redirects properly
- ✅ **Handles Edge Cases**: Works for admin users, expired sessions, etc.
- ✅ **Informative Logging**: Clear console messages for debugging

## Testing
1. Login with any account type (admin, seller, buyer)
2. Click logout
3. Should see successful logout without errors
4. Should be redirected to landing page
5. Console should show appropriate messages without errors

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced logout function with session checking

## Notes
The logout process now handles all scenarios gracefully:
- **Active session**: Properly signs out from Supabase
- **No session**: Skips Supabase signOut and clears local state
- **SignOut errors**: Continues with logout despite Supabase errors
- **Always succeeds**: User state is always cleared and navigation works
