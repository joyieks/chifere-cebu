# Seller Signup & OTP Flow - FIXED ✅

## What I Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Removed ID Upload Before Registration
- **Problem**: ID upload was happening before user creation, using 'temp_user_id'
- **Fix**: User is created first, then ID documents can be uploaded in KYC step with actual user ID

### 2. ✅ Added OTP Email Verification
- Registration sends OTP code to user's email using emailjs
- User must enter the code to verify their email
- Resend code option available
- Console logs added for debugging

### 3. ✅ Seller Pending Review Screen
- **Old**: "Congratulations! You can now start selling"
- **New**: "Account Pending Review" with:
  - Yellow warning icon
  - Clear status indicators
  - Message that admin approval is needed
  - Can't access dashboard until approved

### 4. ✅ Blocked Pending Sellers from Dashboard
- Added check in ProtectedRoute
- If `seller_status === 'pending'`, shows:
  - "Account Pending Review" screen
  - Status indicators
  - Back to Login button
- Sellers can only access dashboard after admin approves them

## Signup Flow Now:

### For Buyers:
1. Choose "Buyer" → Fill form → **Register**
2. **OTP sent to email** → Enter code → Verify
3. Success! → Login → Access Buyer Dashboard ✅

### For Sellers:
1. Choose "Seller" → Fill form → **Register**  
2. **Upload KYC documents** (ID front/back) with real user ID
3. **OTP sent to email** → Enter code → Verify
4. **"Account Pending Review" screen** → Login
5. **BLOCKED from dashboard** until admin approves
6. Admin approves → Email notification → **Can now access Seller Dashboard** ✅

## OTP Configuration:

Make sure your `otpService.js` is configured with:
- **emailjs** service ID
- **emailjs** template ID  
- **emailjs** public key

The OTP code is sent via email and must be entered to verify the account.

## Admin Approval Process:

1. Seller signs up → Status: **"pending"**
2. Admin sees seller in Admin Dashboard → **"Pending Sellers"** section
3. Admin reviews KYC documents
4. Admin clicks **"Approve"** → Status changes to **"approved"**
5. Seller receives email notification
6. Seller can now login and access Seller Dashboard

## Files Modified:

1. ✅ `Signup.jsx` - Fixed registration flow, removed early ID upload, added pending review screen
2. ✅ `ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Added pending seller check to block dashboard access

## Test It:

1. Go to Signup page
2. Choose **Seller**
3. Fill in all fields
4. Click **Register** (user created first)
5. **Upload KYC docs** (with real user ID)
6. Check your **email for OTP code**
7. Enter code → Verify
8. See **"Account Pending Review"** screen
9. Login → Try to access dashboard → **BLOCKED** ⛔
10. Admin approves you
11. Login again → **Dashboard access granted** ✅

## Console Logs:

Look for these logs to debug:
- `📝 [Signup] Starting registration for:`
- `✅ [Signup] User created successfully:`
- `📧 [Signup] Sending OTP to:`
- `⏳ [ProtectedRoute] Seller account pending approval`

Perfect! The seller signup flow now works properly with OTP verification and pending approval blocking! 🎉
