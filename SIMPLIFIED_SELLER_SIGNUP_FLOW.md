# Simplified Seller Signup Flow

## ✅ **KYC Step Removed - Clean Flow**

### **🎯 New Simplified Flow:**

1. **Step 1:** Choose "Sign up as Seller"
2. **Step 2:** Fill registration form + Upload ID documents
3. **Step 3:** Enter OTP code (FORCED to stay visible)
4. **Step 4:** Pending Review page

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **Removed KYC Step Completely:**
   - No more unnecessary KYC upload step
   - ID documents already uploaded in registration form
   - Direct flow from registration to OTP

2. **Forced OTP Step to Stay Visible:**
   - Added `forceOtpStep` state
   - OTP step renders if `step === 3 || forceOtpStep`
   - Multiple safeguards to prevent disappearing

3. **Enhanced Form Submission:**
   - `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`
   - Multiple state flags to track progress
   - Robust step management

### **🧪 Test the Fixed Flow:**

1. **Go to `/signup`**
2. **Select "Sign up as Seller"**
3. **Fill the form:**
   - Store Name: "Test Store"
   - Store Address: "123 Test St"
   - Business Info: "Test business"
   - Contact: "+639123456789"
   - Email: **Your real email**
   - Password: "Test123!"
   - ID Type: "Driver's License"
   - Upload ID documents (front and back)
4. **Click "Register"**
5. **OTP form should appear and STAY visible**
6. **Check your email for the OTP code**
7. **Enter the 6-digit code**
8. **See "Pending Review" page**

### **🔍 Debug Console Logs:**

You should see these logs in the browser console:
- `🔍 [Signup] Form submitted, preventing default behavior`
- `🔍 [Signup] Setting step to 3 (OTP input) and forcing OTP step`
- `🔍 [Signup] Step changed to: 3`
- `🔍 [Signup] Rendering OTP step 3`

### **🎯 Expected Results:**

- ✅ **No KYC step** (removed completely)
- ✅ **OTP form stays visible** (forced to render)
- ✅ **Real OTP emails sent** via EmailJS
- ✅ **Complete signup flow** works end-to-end
- ✅ **Pending review page** shows after OTP verification

### **🚀 The Flow is Now:**

```
Registration Form → OTP Input → Pending Review → Admin Approval
```

**No more KYC step, no more disappearing OTP form!** 🎉

The seller signup flow is now clean, simple, and reliable!
