console.log('üéØ Notification Visibility Fix - Summary');
console.log('=======================================\n');

console.log('üîç Problem Identified:');
console.log('Notifications were showing up in the buyer\'s interface even though they were correctly sent to sellers.');
console.log('The issue was in the frontend notification service - it was fetching ALL notifications instead of filtering by user.\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Root Cause:');
console.log('The notificationService.getNotifications() method was missing the crucial filter:');
console.log('.eq(\'user_id\', currentUserId)');
console.log('This caused all users to see all notifications from all users.\n');

console.log('üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied:');
console.log('==================');
console.log('1. ‚úÖ Fixed notificationService.getNotifications() method');
console.log('   - Added user authentication check');
console.log('   - Added .eq(\'user_id\', currentUserId) filter');
console.log('   - Now only fetches notifications for the current user\n');

console.log('2. ‚úÖ Fixed notificationService.getUnreadCount() method');
console.log('   - Added user authentication check');
console.log('   - Added .eq(\'user_id\', user.id) filter');
console.log('   - Now only counts unread notifications for the current user\n');

console.log('3. ‚úÖ Fixed NotificationContext.handleNewNotification() method');
console.log('   - Added user filtering in real-time notification callback');
console.log('   - Now ignores notifications not meant for the current user');
console.log('   - Prevents cross-user notification leakage\n');

console.log('üìÅ Files Modified:');
console.log('==================');
console.log('1. chifere-app/src/services/notificationService.js');
console.log('   - Fixed getNotifications() method');
console.log('   - Fixed getUnreadCount() method\n');

console.log('2. chifere-app/src/contexts/NotificationContext.jsx');
console.log('   - Fixed handleNewNotification() callback');
console.log('   - Added user filtering for real-time notifications\n');

console.log('üéØ Expected Result:');
console.log('===================');
console.log('After these fixes:');
console.log('‚úÖ Buyers will only see notifications meant for them');
console.log('‚úÖ Sellers will only see notifications meant for them');
console.log('‚úÖ No more cross-user notification visibility');
console.log('‚úÖ Real-time notifications will be properly filtered');
console.log('‚úÖ Unread counts will be accurate per user');

console.log('\nüß™ How to Test:');
console.log('===============');
console.log('1. Log in as a buyer and check notifications - should only see buyer notifications');
console.log('2. Log in as a seller and check notifications - should only see seller notifications');
console.log('3. Create a new order as a buyer - seller should get notification, buyer should not');
console.log('4. Update order status as a seller - buyer should get notification, seller should not');

console.log('\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Important Notes:');
console.log('===================');
console.log('The database notifications were correctly targeted from the beginning.');
console.log('The issue was purely in the frontend notification service filtering.');
console.log('These fixes ensure proper user isolation for notifications.');
console.log('The notification system will now work as intended!');

console.log('\nüéâ The notification visibility issue has been resolved!');
console.log('Each user will now only see their own notifications.');
