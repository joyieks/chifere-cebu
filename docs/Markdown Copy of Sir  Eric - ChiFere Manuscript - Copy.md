**INTRODUCTION**

**1.3 The Problem**   
Cebu faces significant challenges in waste management and sustainable consumption, with issues such as improper waste segregation, clogged drainage systems, and coastal pollution exacerbated by the lack of structured platforms for second-hand trading and bartering. Informal social media barter groups, while popular, often suffer from trust issues, inefficient trade matching, and unregulated transactions, highlighting the need for an innovative solution like ChiFere Cebu to provide a secure, user-friendly, and sustainable marketplace for second-hand goods and barter exchanges.

**1.4 Objectives**  
This capstone aims to design ChiFere Cebu, a web-based marketplace for bartering and selling pre-loved or second-hand goods.   
Specifically, this capstone seeks to achieve the following sub-objectives:  
    1\. To collect data on trends and procedures in second-hand buying, selling, and bartering practices;

2. To identify mechanisms on the exchange of goods;  
3. To implement messaging and notifications system;  
4. To integrate payment options;

**Conceptual Framework for ChiFere Cebu**

The conceptual framework of this project outlines the key components and relationships that contribute to the success of ChiFere Cebu, a web-based marketplace for bartering and selling second-hand goods. The integral components of the project are the independent variables, specifically ChiFere Trading Practices and the Technology Stack—a combination of software tools and technologies.

The ChiFere Website is a digital platform designed to facilitate the exchange and sale of pre-loved items. By integrating advanced technologies, the platform offers enhanced item search with filters and categories, a secure payment system with multiple options, messaging and communication features, a feedback and rating mechanism for trust-building, and bartering system integration with well-defined categories. This comprehensive approach aims to streamline user experience, increase engagement in the pre-loved market, improve trust and security, and promote sustainability through item reuse.  
Data-driven insights will be leveraged to optimize marketplace operations, enhance user interactions, and ensure secure transactions. Ultimately, ChiFere Cebu strives to transform the second-hand goods market by providing a seamless, efficient, and user-centric platform.	

**2.3 Software Engineering**

ChiFeRe will be using a Waterfall model to guide the development process. This approach organizes the project into distinct phases, where each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a logical and structured development of ChiFeRe. This model is ideal for projects where requirements and goals are defined early on, allowing the team to meet objectives before progressing to the next stage.

Preliminary Research. The development of ChiFeRe is based on an in-depth analysis of pre-loved items or second-hand goods market in Cebu, identifying the core features necessary for a functional and efficient online bartering and selling platform. This initial research supports the project by establishing a strong foundation for the platform’s design and functionality.

Requirements Gathering and Analysis. Researchers will conduct interviews with potential users, such as sellers and buyers of pre-loved or second-hand items to understand their specific needs and preferences in second-hand trading. Based on this feedback, the platform’s key features will be finalized, including user registration, item listing and management, a bartering system, secure payment processing, messaging and communication tools, and advanced item search with filters and categories. These core functions will be further refined throughout the development process.

System Design Phase. Once the requirement’s gathering phase is complete, the project will move into the System Design phase. This stage will focus on designing the system architecture to define ChiFeRe’s overall structure, developing a database to store and manage user profiles, product listings, and transaction details, and creating user interface mock-ups to visualize the platform’s key features. The primary goal of this phase is to develop a user-friendly, efficient, and secure marketplace that facilitates seamless transactions and enhances user experience in the pre-loved or second-hand goods market.

​	​The comparative analysis highlights the unique features of ChiFere Cebu relative to platforms such as eBay, Carousell, and Facebook Marketplace. Each feature demonstrates how ChiFere Cebu stands out as a solution for preloved trading in Cebu. Unlike other platforms, ChiFere Cebu places a strong emphasis on second-hand items, offering an innovative approach that promotes sustainability by extending the lifecycle of goods and reducing waste. While eBay, Carousell, and Facebook Marketplace facilitate the sale of preloved items, ChiFere Cebu enhances this experience with localized support and advanced features tailored to Cebu-based buyers and sellers.​  
A key differentiator is ChiFere Cebu's integrated bartering capability, allowing users to exchange items directly without monetary transactions. While informal negotiations are common on Facebook Marketplace, there is no dedicated bartering feature. This functionality is absent in both eBay and Carousell.​  
ChiFere Cebu prioritizes secure payment options by integrating with local payment providers, ensuring a seamless and safe transaction process. In contrast, eBay and Carousell offer secure payment systems but may not cater specifically to local preferences. Facebook Marketplace often relies on external arrangements for payments, lacking a built-in secure system.​  
The platform also includes a user rating and review system, enhancing trust and transparency between buyers and sellers. While this feature is present in eBay and Carousell, it is absent in Facebook Marketplace, where transactions rely more on informal arrangements.​  
ChiFere Cebu's strong environmental sustainability focus actively promotes the reuse of preloved goods to minimize waste. While global e-commerce platforms enable second-hand sales, they do not emphasize sustainability as a core mission, making ChiFere Cebu an appealing option for eco-conscious consumers.​  
ChiFere Cebu also fosters community engagement and economic growth by providing direct support to local sellers and buyers in Cebu. Unlike eBay or Carousell, which cater to a broader audience, ChiFere Cebu integrates with local courier services, ensuring fast and efficient deliveries within the region. Facebook Marketplace has initiated collaborations with delivery services like DoorDash and DeliverEnd for local deliveries in certain regions, but such services may not be available in all areas.​  
Additionally, the platform leverages advanced technology features such as AI-driven search optimization and transaction management, surpassing the capabilities of mainstream marketplaces.​  
Through these features, ChiFere Cebu addresses gaps left by existing platforms and introduces an unparalleled trading experience for Cebuano users. Its combination of sustainability, security, community focus, and technological innovation positions it as a forward-thinking solution that enhances the second-hand market in Cebu.
