# 🛒 Cart - DATABASE ONLY (No localStorage)

## ✅ CHANGES COMPLETED

### 1. Database Setup
**File:** `DISABLE_RLS_CART_DATABASE_ONLY.sql`

- ✅ Disabled RLS (Row Level Security) to prevent permission errors
- ✅ Removed all RLS policies
- ✅ Granted full permissions to all users
- ✅ Cart works directly with database (no restrictions)

### 2. CartContext Changes
**File:** `src/contexts/CartContext.jsx`

**Removed:**
- ❌ localStorage cart for guest users
- ❌ Guest cart merging on login
- ❌ localStorage fallbacks
- ❌ All localStorage read/write operations

**Now:**
- ✅ Cart ONLY works with database
- ✅ Users MUST login to use cart
- ✅ No localStorage at all
- ✅ Cart persists in database forever
- ✅ Guest users see "Please login to add items"

(Sellers can't buy, only sell)
```

## 📊 Database Structure

**Table:** `buyer_add_to_cart`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| user_id | UUID | References auth.users (buyer) |
| items | JSONB | Array of cart items |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | When cart was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last modified (auto-updates) |

**Example Row:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc-123-...",
  "user_id": "user-xyz-...",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "product-1",
      "name": "Laptop",
      "price": 999.99,
      "quantity": 1,
      "image": "https://...",
      "sellerId": "seller-123",
      "addedAt": "2025-10-23T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "product-2",
      "name": "Mouse",
      "price": 29.99,
      "quantity": 2,
      "image": "https://...",
      "sellerId": "seller-456",
      "addedAt": "2025-10-23T10:35:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-10-23T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-23T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## 🔍 Verification

After running SQL script, check in Supabase:

**1. RLS Should Be DISABLED:**
```sql
SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'buyer_add_to_cart';
-- Expected: false
```

**2. No Policies:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'buyer_add_to_cart';
-- Expected: 0
```

**3. Permissions Granted:**
```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_name = 'buyer_add_to_cart';
-- Should see: anon, authenticated, service_role
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Guest Users Can't Use Cart:**
   - Must login first
   - No localStorage cart anymore
   - Shows alert: "Please login to add items"

2. **RLS is Disabled:**
   - No permission restrictions
   - Cart works directly with database
   - No "new row violates row-level security" errors

3. **localStorage Removed:**
   - Cart never saves to localStorage
   - All cart data is in database only
   - Safer and more reliable

4. **Cart Never Lost:**
   - Logout doesn't delete cart
   - Cart stays in database forever
   - Login restores cart from database

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still see "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE public.buyer_add_to_cart DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT ALL ON public.buyer_add_to_cart TO anon, authenticated;
```

### Issue: Cart is empty after login
**Solution:**
Check browser console (F12) for errors. Look for:
```
🛒 [CartContext] Loading user cart from database
🛒 [CartContext] User cart loaded: X items
```

### Issue: "Please login" alert even when logged in
**Solution:**
Check if user object exists:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('User:', user);
// Should show user details, not null
```
