# OTP Step Removal - Simplified Buyer Flow

## Changes Made
Removed the OTP verification step entirely and simplified the buyer registration flow to show a success message with email confirmation instructions.

## New Buyer Flow

### **Before (Complex):**
1. Fill registration form → Submit
2. OTP sent to email → Show OTP verification form
3. User enters 6-digit code → Verify
4. Success message → Login button

### **After (Simplified):**
1. Fill registration form → Submit
2. OTP sent to email → Success message
3. User checks email and confirms → Login button

## Code Changes

### **1. Removed OTP Step (Step 3):**
- Deleted entire OTP verification form
- Removed OTP input field and verification logic
- Removed resend code functionality
- Removed back to registration button

### **2. Simplified Form Submission:**
```jsx
// Before
if (otpResult.success) {
  setStep(3); // Show OTP verification step
} else {
  setStep(4); // Go to success step
}

// After
// Go directly to success step for buyers
setStep(4);
showToast('Registration successful! Please check your email and confirm it.', 'success');
```

### **3. Updated Success Message:**
```jsx
// Before
<h1>Email Verified!</h1>
<p>Your buyer account has been successfully created and verified. You can now login to start shopping!</p>
<button>Login Again</button>

// After
<h1>Registration Successful!</h1>
<p>Your buyer account has been successfully created. Please check your email and confirm it to complete your registration.</p>
<button>Go to Login</button>
```

### **4. Cleaned Up State Variables:**
```jsx
// Removed
const [otpSent, setOtpSent] = useState(false);
const [showOtpModal, setShowOtpModal] = useState(false);

// Kept
const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
const [userType, setUserType] = useState(null);
```

### **5. Removed Debug Code:**
- Removed debug button
- Removed debug indicators
- Removed OTP step rendering logic
- Cleaned up console logs

## User Experience

### **Buyer Registration:**
1. **Fill out form** → Name, email, password, etc.
2. **Submit form** → Registration processed
3. **Success message** → "Registration successful! Please check your email and confirm it."
4. **Check email** → User receives OTP email
5. **Confirm email** → User clicks link or enters code in email
6. **Login** → User can now login to their account

### **Seller Registration (Unchanged):**
1. **Fill out form** → Registration + ID upload
2. **Submit form** → Registration processed
3. **Pending review** → "Your account is pending admin approval"
4. **Admin approval** → Admin approves/rejects
5. **Login** → Seller can login after approval
